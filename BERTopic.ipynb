These are thicker socks, so I like to wear my larger shoes with them. It's amazing how well they breathe! My feet are NEVER hot. So amazing! Highly recommend! They also have a 30 day guarantee incase you don't love them--but you will.\n","TOPIC: ['socks', 'sock', 'shoes', 'boots', 'comfortable', 'wear', 'worn', 'comfy', 'feet', 'soft']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: So far they fit great and wash well.

Our Santa came with his own beard and white hair - not as thick and full as the fake stuff but he looked more approachable like that with the hood down.  No padding.  The feedback from the parents was great.  He wasn't scary at all and much more welcoming to the kids than the traditional department store Santa.

I haven't usually worn Playtex bras as their sizing is so very different than other bras.  I generally wear, in most brands, a 38DD.  I thought if I went up a band size and down a cup size, I'd have the perfect bra.  Well, the cups pucker a bit with this experiement.  Still, the bra would be okay under bulky sweaters, so I am keeping it.  I have since tried on the 40C version of this bra, and it fits much better, although still not 100% T-shirt worthy.  I'm still getting it, it's close enough.  This does do a good job of lifting, which is pretty darned impressive with no wires.  Love the comfort and has re-introduced me to Playtex, in general, which I'm finding makes a very decent bra at a great price...just be sure to go to Playtex and see their sizing chart.  You won't be the same size as you've been anywhere else that I've come across so far.  But, hey....the bras fit no matter what the size is called, and buying a few won't break the bank.

I could have personally done without the packaging peanuts though.  They made quite the mess of my apartment and my little dog, Precious, ate a few and shat them out on the carpet.  ewwww......

While on the 5 mile trail to grandmother's house I was attacked and barely escaped a wolf.  I was hoping after I smacked it on the nose it would be the last time I would see him.

While the pants were the right length, the cut at the crotch was awkward and really tight with the rest of the elastic waistband extending wayyyy higher than it should have proportionately.

It fits beautifully (I wear size 12, misses), and seems well-made.  It is a glamorous dress, very feminine, and yet modest.  It is pretty on-the-shoulder and striking off-the-shoulder.  The skirt is very full, with a lovely swirl.  The smocked waistband is flattering, as well.<br /><br />I am subtracting one star because the color does run, even when handwashed in cold water.  Be aware of this.  I advise dry cleaning, rather than washing.  Under NO circumstances should you wash this with other items.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the rayon fabric is rather thin.  For me, this really isn't a problem, because the color is a rich, dark brown, and the skirt is so full that I don't need a slip with it.  However, if you are at the upper end of the size allowance, the dress could be too thin.

So, the Cami Secret snaps on but rides super high because of the full-coverage of  my bras.<br /><br />In addition, they're made of this slippery microfiber that rides up and scoots around, revealing my bra.<br /><br />A great fix would be something that anchors at the bottom of the bra too without pulling.<br /><br />Ugh.. I bought a similar pack several months ago and I really liked it. I use it all the time.  This set of Cami Secret was a disappointment.  I do not like the fastner. It does not hold in place and is flimsy.  The first set had a snap on closure which was sturdy and I love it.  I wish I knew about the fastner when they talk about the product on the website.

I buy a pair or two ever three years.  I still have some from about 12 years ago that are starting to wear out.

Depending on my weight I wear 32-34 inch waist and all three sizes fit the same way.  They shrink a little after the first wash and the color dulls almost imediatly but stays &#34;Dark&#34; for some time depending on washing habits.  The fit of the Regular Fit is narrow at the waist and hips helps the stay up with or with out a blt, (although they are not as comfortable with out one) snug on the thighs and strait down along the calf.

Yes, I experienced &#34;scarf envy.&#34;<br /><br />But, I will give this away and feel good about it. The pattern is true to the product photo. The red is vibrant giving it just enough pop. The twisted fringes at the bottom are something that I've not seen before but I really like them. They give the scarf a finished look. (see photo)<br /><br />Please note that this 12 x 72 inch cashmere feel scarf is 100% acrylic. I knew this going into the purchase and purposely bought acrylic so that it could be washed. They recommend hand-washing and drying it flat.<br /><br />It has such a nice look and feel that with proper laundering it will serve the user well for quite some time. I would not hesitate to purchase this again and am considering buying one for another family member.\n","TOPIC: ['scarf', 'scarfs', 'scarves', 'cloak', 'wear', 'handkerchief', 'shawl', 'silk', 'colorful', 'pretty']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: The costume looks great.

This particular wig comes in the exact color and length shown and does have as skin cap at the part. It is styled to the character shown but can be easily restyled if you want it for something else like I did. The wig is large, which is good for big heads like mine, and can accommodate copious amounts of hair. The only downside it that, like most commercial wigs, this wig has a bit of a sheen that gives it an air of artificiality and it can not be styled with heating tools.

The \\\\\"Make It Count\\\\\" pumps feature a cushioned heel bed that make these shoes you can wear all day without having to rub your feet at night. I bought the black/white tweed pair, and loved them so much, I also bought the snazzier mauve tweed pair. Generally speaking, I'm more Morticia Adams (i.e. black is best) than Elle Woods, but I LOVE this taupe/pink color on the mauve shoes. It's a netural shade of pink that isn't bubble gummy at all. Get yourself a grown up version of the Mary Jane style shoe.

The crimson comes with dark blue/almost black accents.  The Aspen colors are muted olive/sage and black.  We wore these coats on a hike where we not only got rained on, we got hailed on!  I liked the design of the hood.  It gives good coverage without blocking too much side vision.  It rolls up into the collar and zips out of sight when not needed.  Cords at the hood and waist draw tight to block out the wind. There are ample pockets, both inside and out, one of which doubles as a zip up pouch into which the entire coat can be rolled.  The sleeves are a little long and wide for a woman, but actually this came in handy when I wanted other layers underneath.  We stayed quite dry, except for some spots on the upper chest area where either the seam (between the accent colors) or the Columbia logo allows for leakage.  The sleeve seams did not appear to leak.  I'd recommend some light gloves, as my hands were cold and clammy in the pockets, which are lined with the same water repellant material as the coat.  Despite the vents in the shoulderblade area, this coat will not breathe enough to double as a windbreaker on a dry day.  But if you don't want to let a grey, rainy day keep you inside, or want to be prepared for an unexpected shower by keeping it in your pack, this is a great choice.\n","TOPIC: ['jacket', 'jackets', 'sweater', 'coat', 'sweatshirt', 'suit', 'swimsuit', 'vest', 'sleeves', 'zipper']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: I bought these from a Kohls or Macy's a long while back and I loved them very much. The ones listed here are different though These are the exact same look, but a different design, possibly different fabric too. I have looked everywhere for the same type of boxer's I once loved (and still own), but these are not the same.  PROS: -Easy access front pocket -Durability: These will not breakdown easily -Leg length is not too long -Very lightweight and breathable  CONS: -My jewels feel way too much constriction. I am a boxer brief guy, but I need more room to stretch out or simply not as tight of a fit.  OTHER THOUGHTS: I wear these for everyday purpose and for running/working out. During workouts I feel fine and the support is necessary, only minor adjusting. During everyday use, I feel I am constantly adjusting and wishing I had more room. My other pairs of Champion Smart Temp Boxer Briefs look exactly the same and yet I have the right amount of support and comfort.\n","TOPIC: ['jeans', 'pants', 'denim', 'shorts', 'waist', 'wear', 'underwear', 'levis', 'fit', 'size']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: I am 125lbs and 5'3.

He loves the multiple pockets, he can fit all of his cards, money, and important receipts and not have them sticking out or bulging the wallet. He is kind of hard on wallets but this one has stood up quite well so far. The color is almost exactly as pictured and even with it having faded a little by now, it still looks as professional and well made as it did when he got it. The tin was a little dented when I got it but was a lovely surprise and had the Fossil logo on it. This wallet is appealing to the eye and fits comfortably in his back pocket.

It came in the mail today and it was a medium, while i am either an XS or a small. The cups of the top looked way too huge for even a medium. They had barely any push up and there was alot of room in the cups(too much room) for a medium size. It covers your whole breast without being able to show it a bit on top like the photo. The color is nothing like the picture, it is very bright neon orange and the bottoms were huge on me. The photo uses a neoprene material swimsuit which it is not. It is very thin elastic and if I were to get underwater in the bottoms it would should every crease (like my buttcrack) very easily. If it was only $7 it clearly was made for much less and it is obvious.

And I'm tired of showing muffin top with my simple plain shirts over jeans or leggins. So I am learning to wear plus size. I bought this cover up in ivory after really enjoying another evogue shirt. This item is pretty. However it makes me look a bit like I'm pregnant (picture included), but I imagine that if I had a larger chest that would not be the case. It looks nice from the front.

I got it a size larger so that it would be extra long on me, as I'm tall 5'10, and I also like looser fitting dresses. This dress is great and looks amazing in person! the material is so so and comfortable too and has really great stretch! I really loved how it gave my boyish figure a great hourglass shape!<br /><br />The dress is perfect for the office, just wear with your favorite black blazer and pumps. It also makes it super easy to go from office to happy hour too! Lose the jacket and trade in the bag for a chic clutch and the pumps for some gorgeous stilettos.<br /><br />The dress is completely versatile and will look great for so many occasions. I relayed loved the cute polka dot print as well, as it stands out in a sea of solid colored dresses you usually find, especially at the office!<br /><br />The dress feels very high quality, There are no weird seems and no loose threads. The material is thick and feels warm. It also comes with a lovely matching belt.<br /><br />I know I will be wearing this dress for many years to come, and the style is always a classic which can be worn over and over and will always look great! I highly recommend this dress as a great piece to add to any wardrobe!<br /><br />I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.\n","TOPIC: ['dress', 'dresses', 'skirt', 'wear', 'robe', 'fabric', 'fit', 'beautiful', 'wedding', 'comfortable']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: Fit my daughter snug, and she usually wears 6-9 month clothing.

Living in Arizona, he was not prepared for the weather awaiting him, so we had to get him some warm clothing.  Cabellas had these but they were quite a bit more money.  We tried it on and were going to buy it but the size and color combination were not available for a few days.  When we got home, we checked on Amazon, and not only is/was it available, but its cheaper!!  We ordered it and 2 days later it arrives.<br /><br />It comes as follows---The outer shell, and liner complete and in one bag.  The liner is zipped inside the outer shell, ready for wearing.<br /><br />The idea is that you wear the outer shell alone, or with the liner zipped inside--  depending on how cold it is.<br /><br />THe outer shell---is the color part, and is heavy and thick, is waterproof, is like a heavy nylon jacket with 2 pockets on sides, one inside.<br />The LINER--is fleece, very warm, very soft, and has a pocket on chest.  Its also heavy and thick.  See the photos--you can see all of this clearly.<br /><br />Its also got a very warm hood to keep your head warm.<br /><br />Either can be worn alone and they look great.  The outer shell looks like a jacket, the inner liner looks like a fleece sweater jacket or fleece shirt.<br /><br />If and when the weather turns cold, and/or is wet, then you zip the liner into the outer shell and voila, you have a winter coat.  It works well.  There are many different colors, and the quality is second to none.  Its really an excellent concept, especially for situations where you are planning to travel, or planning a ski trip, and dont need a \\\\\"parka\\\\\" except for that one time.  This allows you to have all options open and available for many different climates.  I recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />IT truly is 3 different--completely different coat/jackets in ONE.

It rained, he looked cute and Halloween wasn't ruined (again).<br /><br />Fast-forward to this ridiculous, polar vortex that is gripping the Midwest. I am clearing out snow and need a hat.

No it was not the only gift, actually she was told that her last gift had to wait until she was feeling frisky.  Curiosity got the best of her and that night she asked about it.  When she wants to be, my wife is as sexy as anyone, but she's not always comfortable with her body so feeling sexy is not as common for her as it may be to others.  Did this outfit help?  Yes I believe it did, 3-4 days after we first tried it out - she asked to wear it again!  I haven't specifically asked her if she feels sexy in it.  It's a naughty and sexy thing to wear so I would imagine she felt a little of both.  I can tell you that we have both really enjoyed ourselves every time this outfit has been involved so far.<br /><br />Like the other reviews state, this thing truly is one-size fits all.  I ordered the one-size queen for my wife and it worked well, but I also think the regular one-size would have worked for her as well.  The queen would work for someone from 180 to 300 pounds or more.  My wife is about 185-190, 5'6\\\\\", size 12-14 top, size 16-20 bottom.

This bra has the strangest straps. They don't seem secure at all. There is an ugly row of elastic loops going up the outside back of the strap. Hooks on the rear of the band fit into one of these loops of elastic. The loop you select determines the length of the strap, for fit. The excess tucks loosely under the band, against your back. The edging of the entire bra is some rough material that felt like it would abrade my skin. The elastic band feels very heavy-duty. The coverage the cups provide is actually quite good, and the fit was perfect. Cup shaping was also very good, especially for a sports bra. I imagine that is one did not have sensitive skin, vulnerable to abrasion by clothing, this would be an ideal sports bra, provided the straps stay secured.\n","TOPIC: ['dress', 'bra', 'costume', 'wear', 'fit', 'comfortable', 'shirt', 'fabric', 'size', 'medium']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: no problems at all\n","TOPIC: ['jeans', 'fit', 'wear', 'size', 'comfortable', 'shirt', 'small', 'fits', 'fabric', 'large']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: I bought the size 7-8 for my daughter who wears a size 6.

It's lightweight (perfect for layering in the fall), has 4 useful pockets, a removable hood (note: the hood is attached with snap buttons, not with a zipper like it says in the description - I like this better, since it won't snag my hair like a zipper might), and has a drawstring to cinch your waist. The only (minor) downside is that, on my screen, the jacket looked a dark olive green (it's actually a regular olive green) but this isn't such a big deal.    Sizing:  I'm a petite woman (5'0, 105 lbs) and I normally wear a size Small. After reading reviews to size up, I ordered the size 1X (the Large was out of stock, so I went ahead and bought the 1X). The 1X turned out to be too big and baggy on me, so I returned it and ordered the Large as soon as it became available again. It fits me perfectly! All in all, I'd highly recommend sizing up about 2 sizes; the \\\\\"Large\\\\\" in this jacket fits like a Small.    Customer Service:  These guys at the company are so great! When I realized the 1X didn't fit me properly, I contacted them to see if and when they would restock the Large. I didn't expect an answer anytime soon, but they responded to my message the same day. They were courteous and polite and so, so helpful in their response. I'm very impressed! Also, shipping was very quick; my parcel arrived a lot sooner than I expected.

I normally wear a 14 petite.  I sent it back and ordered a 2X, there was no 1X in the plus sized costumes.  This second costume is huge.  I will have to take it to a tailor to have it fitted properly.  Due to the details of the costume and the fact that the collar is set such that it has to go over your head, it won't be a simple fix.  I'm a teacher and this year's prom theme is Alice In Wonderland, so I really need this to work.

I am 5 11 and 195 pounds.<br /><br />As I prefer close-fitting clothes this makes finding jackets and shirts hard and so far impossible. However, what I can do is find something with approximate shoulders and tailor the rest to fit. This is what I had done to this coat.<br /><br />An XL fits me perfectly across the shoulders and just a tad tight (I prefer that) around the chest, but with enough fabric around the waist to fit a small bowling ball. I therefore had it taken in, and had the sleeves chopped off 2 inches, resulting in a perfect-fit coat. Cost was $30 to bring the total cost to this jacket to about $105.<br /><br />Girls pretty much freak when they see this coat...I bought it in beige and it's like catnip to the ladies. :D Now I have an inkling on what it feels like to be a hot chick and getting hit on all the time.<br /><br />I suspect it works really well if your waist to shoulder ratio is, as many scientific articles attest as being very attractive to women, less than .75.

I'm updating based on nearly a year of wear of this style. They still fit, although they've stretched a bit and still look flattering, but they do NOT \\\\\"wear like iron\\\\\" as I expect from this brand.  I have NYDJ jeans quite a few years older than these that look less worn, even though I've worn and washed them frequently. I have another jeans brand that cost $12.99 four years ago which I only wear for heavy house and yard work that have held up better than these. Topstiching threads have come loose, and the fabric is pilling. The price keeps rising. I paid $87.50 here - much lower than most NYDJ jeans. I liked them so much I went to my account to \\\\\"buy it again.\\\\\" They were then $104, later $114, now $130! I had ordered a pair in black (still called Alina) from Nordstrom's. They were of even poorer quality, had fewer details and did not fit at all; I returned them. I'm thinking NYDJ contracts their manufacturing out to various factories and accepts inconsistent standards for styles they name the same. This is certainly not the way to protect a status brand. I pay for a brand because I know what to expect.  I wonder now if they're made in USA because of the sloppiness of sewing and lack of uniformity of fit and style. The fabric used in the pair I own and the ones I sent back are not the same. $130 is a high price for jeans, but I'd pay it for a pair that would continue to fit and look good for a long time. I've lowered my rating to two stars because of lack of durability + increased price. (The constant price-changing on Amazon is getting on my nerves.)<br /><br />Original Review, December 6, 2013<br /><br />\\\\\"I've been buying NYDJ jeans for years and think they're great. They're expensive, but they wear like iron, fit well and are Made in USA. They hold in the tummy and lift the butt. I called their customer service and asked about the Alina style. I specifically asked about the inseam length and the person promised to find out and get back to me. That never happened. She also insisted that I should buy the same size in this style as my other NYDJ jeans - 6P. Turns out I could not zip the 6P. They also run a bit short for jeans and a little loose for leggings. Just so you know. I exchanged for 8P, had no problem with fit or comfort. I recommend them for what they are: skinny pants, not leggings.\\\\\"ind out and get back to me. That never happened.

The fabric does not hurt my skin, and it definitely smooths a figure. Again, if you want it to tuck in some stuff and are more or less my size, I suggest you order an M.

Hard to put into words, but VERY easy on the eyes and NOT like \\\\\"all the other\\\\\" light blue shirts.  The texture of the fabric is excellent.  No pocket. 100% Polyester.  Made in Bangladesh.  Machine wash cold, tumble dry low.  But the tag inside the collar is a bit annoying.  All this good stuff and you're constantly annoyed by the stiff tag.  Maybe it will soften with time/washings.  Ash City ships by UPS - for me, that's a PLUS.  So 5 stars overall.\n","TOPIC: ['jeans', 'fit', 'wear', 'size', 'comfortable', 'shirt', 'small', 'fits', 'fabric', 'large']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: Good product.\n","TOPIC: ['quality', 'pricey', 'cheap', 'price', 'worth', 'cheaply', 'brand', 'purchase', 'made', 'expensive']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: Wallet is nice and everything, but my Fiancé felt that it was too big, I have to put it in my purse sometimes for him.<br />I will be returning it.\n","TOPIC: ['wallet', 'wallets', 'purse', 'pocket', 'card', 'cards', 'pockets', 'backpack', 'cash', 'bag']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: This t-shirt was a more than i would normally pay for a t-shirt, but it fits so well and you can bearly see through it at all, this was my main concern when shopping for a white t-shirt.\n","TOPIC: ['dress', 'bra', 'costume', 'wear', 'fit', 'comfortable', 'shirt', 'fabric', 'size', 'medium']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: Lil small for a Xtra large\n","TOPIC: ['jeans', 'fit', 'wear', 'size', 'comfortable', 'shirt', 'small', 'fits', 'fabric', 'large']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: The eyes didn't look like eyes.

I read the reviews before I purchased & saw they were made in Bangladesh, meaning you really need to size up. Bangladesh makes top quality products, they just size differently than Americans. I am 6'1&#34; & weigh 185, so I bought the 3X. They fit, but maybe a little too big. I wish now I had bought the 2X & it would have been a perfect fit. The length is perfect, nice & long (as I like the long feel). Just a little too much room in the waist & thigh, but I enjoy wearing them around the home on these cool mornings. The color (maroon) is fine, the elastic waist & draw cord are quality and the thickness (110% cotton) is on the heavy side, not for the summer. They have the standard deep side pockets with two button-down rear pockets, nice. Overall, this was a pleasant find of upper quality Jogger Sweats on Amazon.

(I bought them in the yellow dots design, which is no longer available).  The bamboo viscose material is super-soft and very stretchy, so it moves easily with her when she's active (which is pretty much all the time when she's awake!).  These coveralls are very versatile because the bamboo viscose material is great for temperature regulation.  It keeps my little-one from getting too hot when she's running around & playing, and prevents her from getting too cold when temperatures cool off.  These playsuits are plenty warm enough for us during winters in Southern California, but I probably wouldn't recommend them for very cold winter weather.  Although they do have long sleeves, the pant-legs don't extend all the way to the ankles (they're capri-length), so your child's legs will probably get cold unless they're wearing very tall socks, leg-warmers or tights.  Plus, the material is pretty thin and lightweight, so it probably won't protect your little-one from bitter-cold temperatures unless other clothing is layered over it.<br /><br />For our purposes, however, these coveralls are perfect!<br /><br />Grade: A\n","TOPIC: ['sleepwear', 'blankets', 'blanket', 'sack', 'fleece', 'zipper', 'sleepsack', 'sleeper', 'sleeps', 'sleepsacks']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: On time fits as expected\n","TOPIC: ['fit', 'fits', 'perfectly', 'thank', 'great', 'comfortable', 'excellent', 'perfect', 'bought', 'made']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: It fits like a child's large.

This front pocket wallet is a great product for the price, looks great, can barely feel it in my front pocket. Holds 2 credit cards on the side that the money clip is on, and there is a pocket on the top where you can store business cards or maybe a few more credit cards if you have more than two. I wanted this wallet because it had the visible ID slot on the other side which is great. The only thing I do not enjoy about this wallet is the magnetic money clip. It does NOT hold alot of cash. Not that someone should be carrying alot of money in that clip with them anyways. However I usually carry 50.00 cash on me. One 20 dollar bill, one 10 dollar bill, two 5 dollar bills, and ten 1 dollar bills. The clip could barely hold that much money. Obviously its good to have a few ones around for tips, lotto tickets, etc. If you have a 20 dollar bill on you and you cash it and get change back, dont expect this wallet to hold most of those dollar bills. I wish I would have gone with a money clip that clips down (bends) for lack of a better word. The only way this magnetic clip is going to hold that much money is if you have brand new, crisp, perfectly flat dollar bills. If not, you are going to have a hard time keeping the money in the clip. I was worried through out the day that if I took the wallet out, some money may slip out of the clip. Like I said though, great product for the price, however you might want to search more on Amazon and find a front pocket wallet that does not have the magnetic money clip.. this is the minimalist wallet that I have been looking for. It is well constructed and holds all the information and cash I need for just kicking around. Swiss comes through again.. Bought this to replace a lost wallet. Really pleased with this item.  Holds my ID and several cards which are easily accessible. The money clip works excellent... of course I am not one to carry more than a few bills at a time. Bills stay in place when transitioning in and out of pockets. Doubt I will ever go back to a traditional wallet.. Not what I expected.  The magnet wasn't able to hold my money.  I returned it. I prefer the older clips.. Nice wallet. Like the this money clip overall. However the clear part of the clip, where you put your drivers license in is a bit small. The license fits, but not all of it is visible, so you still have to pull it out. Otherwise the marterial is nice and it's worth the money.. Has been holding up for almost a year now. The corners are a bit bent but the seems have remained strong and it has not torn. I carry about 8 cards total in it without any bulk. The cards don't sit super snug in the sleeves but they've never fallen out and it's the perfect amount of grip in my opinion. Highly recommended.. This product needs to be made with a clip that secures the money. The magnet is not good  My old one did not have one\n","TOPIC: ['jeans', 'fit', 'wear', 'size', 'comfortable', 'shirt', 'small', 'fits', 'fabric', 'large']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: I bought this for my 17-month old son. I purchased the toddler which was rated 1-2 years. He is 31&#34; and 25-30 pounds. However, the robe was way to big for him, probably better for a 3-4 year old. The green hood was fine actually a little small. The hood was very thin material and the ears attached very flimsily so the hung down like a donkey's. Overall the fabric is very thin and is significantly different from the picture. After A LOT of alterations my wife got this looking great by shortening the robe and sewing the ears like a triangle so they stick out horizontally like they should. We also used a feather boa to add some hair to the hood.

I was informed 1/2/2013 personally (through email of course cuz she is very busy) that it was stitched with the best industrial strength line. Its really held up nice. I dont wear it as a hat/scarf as much as i do  a scarf/mittens. Its so warm on your head if u are intending to wear it to do any activity other than walk. (If your climate is dry/cold. Totally different than humid/ cold. Humid/cold is colder) if your climate is humid cold it would be a perfect hat/scarf/mitten. Here in MT cold it gets hotter quicker. BUT!! This hat will be a main dressing point for your collection for a while. Its soft,and VERY fluffy. The batik cotton lining continues into the pocket paws. Love how she shaved away the hair on the bottom ofthe paws. Sheds a tad but go over it LIGHTLY with a furminator and it strips the loose fur nicely.  I get so many questions and oohh and ahhhhhs over it. Especially when i tuck in a reciept in the paws or the long pocket on the inside down the &#34;arms&#34; of my hat lol. Ppl are fascinated when they realize it has ears. Anyways an excellent HANDMADE buy. Shes fast to respond (either within the day or the next). To any emails to. Its a bit faster reply on etsy.com tho.  Overal EXTREMELY pleased. Buy one quick! I think she will blow spirit hoods out of the water honestly. Its handmade and you can custom make your own hat if you choose. My recent suggestion either a serval cat hat with huge ears or a clouded leopard with silver lining.

So heartbroken I told them to just cancel the order and issue a refund( I really wanted this shirt) so I with my lips pokes out like a baby I excepted it as a lost cause but, then today my husband went to the mail box and yeah they found one for me there was only one thing I didn't like and that was a loose button hanging but, no biggie I am just so greatful I got my shirt! love this shirt fabric feels great looks great and I am happy I am most greatful to this company this is my second time ordering from there store and I must say I love there style! Thank you thank you, Love, Karizma!. This was my first online clothes buy and I am disappointed. I wear a size medium, but ordered a large due to the reviews.The sleeves are way too big, they are not fitted around the wrist as it shows on the picture. I do not even if i ordered a medium the sleeves would have been right. However, the body of the shirt fits good, the material is stretchy so I think a smaller size would have been ok, but a bit tight. The worst part has been the neck tie...I have no idea how they made it looks so sleek in the picture. When i make a bow out of it, the bow just sits there below the neck. If you are going to buy a bow tie neck top, i think something smoother, not cotton, is the best choice.\n","TOPIC: ['jeans', 'fit', 'wear', 'size', 'comfortable', 'shirt', 'small', 'fits', 'fabric', 'large']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: Hat was way too small to wear.

I went to Macys yesterday (10/23) and this nice woman messured me. Sure enough  my breast size increased by one number from 34 C to 36 C! Since Im on a budget I decided to buy one sports bra to wear under my scrubs for work. I work in a nursing home. This is the bra I chose and I chose black because it doesnt get as dirty fast as white. I already have a white one thats similar so I decided to get black and I love it! I love the way it stretches, it fits nicely, its well made, and it holds my breasts securely; this is an excellent sports bra!

Trying to wear it frequently is simply too frustrating.\n","TOPIC: ['jeans', 'fit', 'wear', 'size', 'comfortable', 'shirt', 'small', 'fits', 'fabric', 'large']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: I ordered this hoodie just last week and although it's cheaply priced, I didn't expect the construction to be this shoddy.<br />Out of the package, I noted at least 2 loose threads.  It's doomed to come apart within the year with any use.  Additionally, it's shedding the cheap interior insulation material like nothing I've seen.  I have white carpet in a few rooms, and now have burgendy (the color of the hoodie) fuzz balls everywhere.  I washed it once hoping to get this stuff out...to no avail.  Yes, the lint trap was FULL of fuzzies, but I'm still finding these things everywhere: my face, carpet and on any shirt I wear under this hoodie.<br />Pay more, get a much better product.\n","TOPIC: ['jeans', 'fit', 'wear', 'size', 'comfortable', 'shirt', 'small', 'fits', 'fabric', 'large']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: I was very pleased wth product.

They aren't see-thru. The only problem I have is that they are a tad too short for me...hit just above my ankle and I'd rather them hit at the ankle.. For fashion or for dance, working out, etc., these leggings are hard to beat. Great fit, true to size, comfortable, too. They're made well and the Supplex fabric is firm enough for a great fit but not overly constricting. They wash well  and are worth the additional money compared to the flimsy, lower priced leggings in bargain stores.. Great fit and makes you  look sleek and smooth.  These are NOT made of the cheap thin fabric that shows every imperfection.

Initially decided to go for the tavern wench look by using my own blouse, skirt, etc. and purchase a laced-up vest.  However, a decent vest alone would cost more than this costume, so I took a chance on ordering this complete outfit. As others have noted, the costume fits well (even sexy, but not whorish!)  and the material is a good weight.  The outfit does not need a belt, but if you like the belted look, use your own because the one provided cheapens the outfit & does not stay on.  Now, for the caveats - I am 5' tall, 103 lbs, 34B,  and the small fit me perfectly.  Usually in regular street clothes, I am a Petite 2 in dresses.  I am so glad I read the reviews and did not order the &#34;Extra-Small&#34;.  So make sure to size up.  Even though the small fit me perfectly once it was on, it was somewhat challenging to get on - it is all one piece.  To get it off, I had my husband help me carefully get it over my head so I wouldn't accidentally rip the seams or the lacing in the front.  So, it's a little delicate to get on and off, but let's face it, it's not a dress you wear to work every day, so I'm still giving it 5 stars for the style & value.  I would purchase from this company again.\n","TOPIC: ['dress', 'bra', 'costume', 'wear', 'fit', 'comfortable', 'shirt', 'fabric', 'size', 'medium']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: Looked great!

They were not the same quality. Fabric was scratchy. Half of them had a run or hole. And the color was no longer the nude shade that was perfect. They are a scratchy cheap 1970s suntan shade. Loved the first set I ordered. They are still in excellent condition after multiple washings. The second set are useless.) I completely agree with previous reviewer. I can never find the right shade of nude for my fair skin. These are perfect for me! Looks like I'm not wearing hosiery and are super comfortable! &#34;As a pale person, these are the perfect thing. Most nylons in stores don't go a shade lighter than &#34;nude,&#34; which is about 10 shades darker than my actual skin tone. I like wearing these when I don't want to look like I'm wearing socks, but need something thin so my feet don't stick to my shoes and get all sweaty. It's also nice that they're ankle-high. I don't like having to wear knee-highs with pants.&#34;\n","TOPIC: ['jeans', 'fit', 'wear', 'size', 'comfortable', 'shirt', 'small', 'fits', 'fabric', 'large']\n","--*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*----*--\n","TEXT: 👍🏻.

I have already had friends ask me to borrow it so it's highly favored!  The only thing I was a little bummed about is the faux pocket :(  Having that piece of fabric sewn onto the outside of the sweater to look like a pocket was a bit of a disappointment, but I think I'm just going to cut a slit there and sew a pocket inside myself.

It is very plain in cut, and while not unflattering (not overly boxy, but not too fitted either) in fit, it's not exactly flattering either.  I decided to send it back.<br /><br />Except, then, I forgot to.  And I had an unexpected trip and decided to wear it on the plane.  It was actually pretty good on the plane, because it is light enough to fold up and scrunch into a bag if needed, but it does provide warmth--but not too much!--for the cool window seats.  With a t-shirt, it was perfect for medium/long flight (6 hours).  It is very soft, which I like too.  So obviously, I kept it, and since I paid about $14 for it, I figure it was worth it.<br /><br />however, it would never be worth the original price (I would have sent it back for sure).  And it's really only just &#34;ok&#34; even for this low cost.  I can add that when I got to Alaska, I discovered the wind goes through this a little less that it does a cheaply made fleece I might have bought at Walmart, so there's that (but it is not windproof by any means--just a little better than some cheaper fleeces).<br /><br />So if you can get it cheap, and you need a basic back fleece that is slightly more dressy than a hoody, go for it.\n","fit, pockets, warmth, price, wind\n","-----------------------------------\n","\n","Reviews:  My son was quite pleased with this for Christmas.

It is like two-thirds of the skirt is uniform and then someone added a random piece. Still looks lovely on but that is my only complaint about it. I like it a lot because of the tie-dye. So, if you do not like things matching up perfectly this may not be for you.\n","color, panel, match, tie-dye, perfect\n","-----------------------------------\n","\n","Reviews:  its a great dress\n","dress, great\n","-----------------------------------\n","\n","Reviews:  It's not wool, is Acrylic.\n","acrylic, wool\n","-----------------------------------\n","\n","Reviews:  I'm an up an coming transgirl and these fake breasts fit the bill until my hormone regiment is complete...\n","None\n","-----------------------------------\n","\n","Reviews:  I wanted something to ride a bit lower around my waist than the traditional Jockey Classic.

It is very plain in cut, and while not unflattering (not overly boxy, but not too fitted either) in fit, it's not exactly flattering either.  I decided to send it back.<br /><br />Except, then, I forgot to.  And I had an unexpected trip and decided to wear it on the plane.  It was actually pretty good on the plane, because it is light enough to fold up and scrunch into a bag if needed, but it does provide warmth--but not too much!--for the cool window seats.  With a t-shirt, it was perfect for medium/long flight (6 hours).  It is very soft, which I like too.  So obviously, I kept it, and since I paid about $14 for it, I figure it was worth it.<br /><br />however, it would never be worth the original price (I would have sent it back for sure).  And it's really only just &#34;ok&#34; even for this low cost.  I can add that when I got to Alaska, I discovered the wind goes through this a little less that it does a cheaply made fleece I might have bought at Walmart, so there's that (but it is not windproof by any means--just a little better than some cheaper fleeces).<br /><br />So if you can get it cheap, and you need a basic back fleece that is slightly more dressy than a hoody, go for it.\n","Topics:  ['jeans', 'fit', 'wear', 'size', 'comfortable', 'shirt', 'small', 'fits', 'fabric', 'large']\n",". fits small, comfortable, wear with jeans and shirt.\n","tensor([[0.3641]])\n","-----------------------------------\n","\n","Reviews:  My son was quite pleased with this for Christmas.

After my first bad review the company contacted me and said that they'd send another pair free of charge. We recieved the glasses today and   had the same outcome. Although they were packed more carefully, a lense still fell out. It's not the seller's fault... it's just a cheap item.  but it's sold for a cheap price.

It is very plain in cut, and while not unflattering (not overly boxy, but not too fitted either) in fit, it's not exactly flattering either.  I decided to send it back.<br /><br />Except, then, I forgot to.  And I had an unexpected trip and decided to wear it on the plane.  It was actually pretty good on the plane, because it is light enough to fold up and scrunch into a bag if needed, but it does provide warmth--but not too much!--for the cool window seats.  With a t-shirt, it was perfect for medium/long flight (6 hours).  It is very soft, which I like too.  So obviously, I kept it, and since I paid about $14 for it, I figure it was worth it.<br /><br />however, it would never be worth the original price (I would have sent it back for sure).  And it's really only just &#34;ok&#34; even for this low cost.  I can add that when I got to Alaska, I discovered the wind goes through this a little less that it does a cheaply made fleece I might have bought at Walmart, so there's that (but it is not windproof by any means--just a little better than some cheaper fleeces).<br /><br />So if you can get it cheap, and you need a basic back fleece that is slightly more dressy than a hoody, go for it.\n","Topics:  fit, pockets, warmth, price, wind\n","Fit is not flattering, pockets are unusable, not warm enough, cheap, wind resistant.\n","tensor([[0.6099]])\n","-----------------------------------\n","\n","Reviews:  My son was quite pleased with this for Christmas.

Because of the material they did not shrink when I put them in the dryer. BUT they still fit good, just a tad loose. I ordered a second pair in black this time but went with a small. The same happened. They were a little tight but loosened up around the knees and thighs. It's not very noticeable and it's to be expected in pants. Overall these are not &#34;going out&#34; pants. I used them for costume ppurposes but they definitely got the job done.\n","Topics:  fit, material, shrink, tight, job\n","Fits well, material doesn't shrink, tight but loosen up, good for costume.\n","tensor([[0.4814]])\n","-----------------------------------\n","\n","Reviews:  works well. fits as i expected.\n","Topics:  fit, work, well\n","fits well and works well\n","tensor([[0.7874]])\n","-----------------------------------\n","\n","Reviews:  My grandson loved it!\n","Topics:  grandson, love, review\n","5 stars!
